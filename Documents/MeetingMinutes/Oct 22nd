Recap:
  for the most part everyone has been caught up, aside from Evan who needs to complete the hand mechanic implementation. Danny and Evan
  decided it'd be better if Danny took on the hand mechanic, Evan will do more design docs. 
Level Design:
  We decided we would focus the meeting on level design and looked closer at the design we made for the PoC. We looked at what
  we'll need to implement for the PoC as well
Because of preoccupation with midterms, a smaller workload was distributed this week, and the meeting was mostly focused on the specifics 
of the PoC level.
